# Phaser 3, Vite and TypeScript Template (second version)

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is the template I use to start new Phaser 3 projects. It is based on the [official Phaser 3 template](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-vite-ts) and was created using the [create-phaser-game app](https://phaser.io/tutorials/create-game-app).

## How to use this template
